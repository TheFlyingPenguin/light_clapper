light_clapper
=============

The goal of this small project was to create a simple light clapper using Arduino. It's set up so that an Arduino Uno reads the amplified output of an analog microphone to listen for a *clap clap* pattern. When the software recognizes a double clap, the Arduino activates a relay, switching on a connected extension cord and powering on any desired lights or other devices.
